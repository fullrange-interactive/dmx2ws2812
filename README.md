# dmx2ws2812
A device to convert DMX to WS2812.

## What it's about
There are several WS2812-compatible LED strips available on the market. This includes simple RGB strips or the Adafruit Neopixel Ring.

The goal of this project is to have a "fixture" that can be controlled via DMX to drive these LEDs. The fixture has an LCD display as well as a rotary encoder to adjust various settings such as DMX address, DMX mode and others. 

This is a work in progress, and schematics as well as a couple of tips will be provided here.
